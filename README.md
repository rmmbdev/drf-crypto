# DRF Crypto

This package only provides the basic requirements to create a payment system
for any blockchain. It means we will not support any blockchain payment with
this package. The reason is the dynamic nature of the blockchain world. They
change rapidly, and usually, everyone works with a specific blockchain. Also,
there are many different strategies to manage payments on a blockchain. For
example, you may want to verify your transactions with a tag (like a memo), or
maybe you want to create one wallet for each user or each transaction.
